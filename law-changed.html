    <h2>The Law Has Changed</h2>
    <p>
      On 20 May 2020, England introduced a new "opt out" system for organ donation. This means that all adults will be considered to have agreed to donate their organs when they die, unless they have recorded a decision not to donate or are in one of the excluded groups.
    </p>
    <p>This system is also known as Max and Keiraâ€™s Law, inspired by a young donor and recipient whose story saved multiple lives.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Who does it affect?</h2>
    <p>This law applies to people who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are over 18 years old</li>
      <li>Live in England</li>
      <li>Have lived in England for more than 12 months</li>
      <li>Have the mental capacity to understand the change</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It does not apply to children, short-term residents, or people who lack capacity.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why was this law introduced?</h2>
    <p>
      The change aims to save more lives by increasing the number of organs available for transplant. Surveys show most people support organ donation but never get around to registering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opt-out system makes it easier to honor people's intention to donate.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>What do you need to do?</h2>
    <p>
      It is still your choice whether or not to become an organ donor.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can register your decision to donate.</li>
      <li>You can opt out if you do not want to donate.</li>
      <li>Share your decision with your family so they are aware of your wishes.</li>
    </ul>
