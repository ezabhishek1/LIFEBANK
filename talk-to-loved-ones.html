    <p>
      Making the decision to become an organ or tissue donor is a personal and powerful choice. But it’s just as important to
      share that decision with your family. When the time comes, they may be asked to confirm your wishes. If they know what you
      want, they are much more likely to support your decision.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Whatever you decide, it’s really important that you let your loved ones know.
    </div>

    <h2>Why Talking to Family Matters</h2>
    <p>
      In many cases, even if you are on the donor register, your family will be asked to support that decision after your death.
      If they don’t know your wishes, they may hesitate or say no, especially during a difficult emotional time. But when they
      know what you want, it gives them clarity, comfort, and confidence.
    </p>

    <h2>Make It Part of a Conversation</h2>
    <p>
      Talking about organ donation may feel awkward, but it doesn’t have to be. You can bring it up naturally — during dinner,
      while watching TV, or even while discussing your will or future planning. A simple “I’ve decided I want to be an organ
      donor” can be the start of a meaningful conversation.

        <h3>Did you know?</h3>
        <p>
          Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients often wait significantly longer for a successful match than white patients,
          due to a shortage of suitably matched donors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If more people from these ethnic backgrounds donated their organs after death — or as living donors — transplant waiting
          times would reduce.

    <h2>Your family can overturn your decision</h2>
    <p>
      Each year, hundreds of opportunities for transplants are missed because families aren’t sure what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your family will always be consulted about whether you wanted to be an organ donor or not, and clinicians will
      never proceed with organ donation if your family or loved ones object.
    </p>

    <h2>Leave them certain</h2>

    <h3 class="grey">If you want to donate</h3>
    <p>
      If you want to be an organ donor after you die, it's really important that you talk to your loved ones and
      make sure they understand and support your organ donation decision. You can also register your decision
      on the official organ donor register.
    </p>

    <h3 class="grey">If you don't want to donate</h3>
    <p>
      If you decide not to become an organ donor, you can still help your family through a difficult time by
      talking to them about your organ donation decision now, and making sure they know what you want.
      You can also register your decision on the official organ donor register.
    </p>

    <h2>Be Clear, Be Heard</h2>
    <p>
      It’s your decision, and you have the right to make it. But sharing it means your family can carry out your wishes without
      doubt or delay. Let them know. Encourage them to register too. The more we talk, the more lives we can save.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      Don’t keep your decision to yourself. Talk to your loved ones today.
